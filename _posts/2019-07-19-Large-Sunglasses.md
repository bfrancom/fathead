title: Sunglasses for Big Heads
---

For me, it never fails. I go to purchase some sunglasses, put them on for a few seconds, and they look and feel good, so I purchase them.  Then when I actually have to wear them for more than 5 minutes, the pressure from them behind my ears starts giving me a headache. To compensate for this illustrious feeling, I try moving and angling them. But it still freaking hurts, so freaking bad! Need sunglasses for a long road-trip, or a day outdoors? It's gonna cost you a lot...in pain!

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you relief:

## G&G Polarized BBST Big Head XXL Extra Wide 160mm Sunglasses Black Smoke

These puppies are 6.3 inches (160mm) wide, and give relief to even the biggest noggin's. Of all the sunglasses I've had over the years, these have been the most comfortable for my big head.
